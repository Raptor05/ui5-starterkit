This starter kit is intended to help developers create, check, version, and upload SAPUI5 projects to the SAP system. It has been developed especially for use in Webstorm, but can also be applied to other IDEs if necessary.

Supported features are:
* Syntax checks with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and rules adapted for SAPUI5 developments
* Includes the two NPM packages [ui5-codecompletion](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-codecompletion) and [ui5-schemas](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-schemas) (configuration will be explained later)
* Automatic generation of pre-component, minification of JavaScript files and automated upload to the SAP system with [grunt](https://gruntjs.com/)
